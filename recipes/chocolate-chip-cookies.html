    <p>Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed
        ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics.
    </p>

    <div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks
        of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced
        flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help
        hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extracts enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate
        chip cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the 
        cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the 
        baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it
        won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the 
        cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can
        use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuts (optional)</strong>: Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a
        welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>
