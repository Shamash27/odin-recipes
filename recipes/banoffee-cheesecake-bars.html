<div class="steps"><h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>For the Crust:</strong> Line a 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, letting
        excess overhang on two sides. Stir together the graham cracker crumbs and white sugar in a medium
        bowl. Add 1/3 cup melted butter; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour crust mixture into prepared pan and press evenly onto bottom. Chill crust in the
        refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>For the Toffee Sauce Filling:</strong> Meanwhile, melt 1/4 cup butter in a small
        saucepan over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar. Bring to a boil and stir until sugar is dissolved.
        Reduce heat and boil gently, uncovered, for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Carefully stir in 1/3 cup whipping cream. Return to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until
        slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let
        cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>For the Cheesecake:</strong> Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer
        at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add sweetened condensed milk and 1 1/2 cups whipping cream;
        beat until smooth, scrapping down sides of bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Add pudding mixes, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth and well combined
        (mixture will be very thick).</li>
        <li>Spread half of the pudding mixture over the chilled crust in the pan. Top with toffee sauce
        filling, spreading to an even layer.</li>
        <li>Arrange banana slices in an even layer over the toffee filling. Top with dollops of the remaining
        pudding mixture, carefully spreading in an even layer. Chill, covered, at least 4 hours (or up to
        overnight).</li>
        <li>Cut into 16 bars. Top cheesecake bars with sweetened whipped cream and chocolate shavings.</li>
    </ol>
