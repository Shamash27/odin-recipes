# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project built as part of The Odin Project currriculum. The goal is to build a simple
recipe website using only HTML to practice:

 - Creating and structuring HTML pages
 - Using lists, links, and images
 - Navigating between pages with relative paths

## Skills I'll Demonstrate

 - Writing semantic HTML
 - Building a multi-page website
 - Organizing project files and folders
 - Practicing version control with Git

*I will update this README after completing the project to reflect what I've
learned and any challenges I overcame.*
